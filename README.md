# DNA Cryptography Technique using 16 * 16 Play Fair Matrix
It means hiding of original data into a text.The input of text data is processed by using an efficient encryption algorithms which provides the security of data by decrypting the encrypted text as output.In previous they use the 5*5 play fair matrix to encrypt the data. It may cause the BRUTE FORCE ATTACK with less number of permutations to decrypt. So here we use the Extending the BRUTE FORCE ATTACK with 16*16 PLAY FAIR. Here an encryption algorithm is encrypt the original data using DNA play fair matrix that is 16*16. So far we have come across many ideas which involve data encryption using traditional mathematical operations and/or data manipulating DNA techniques.
A. Steps for the encryption
The read plaintext from file (those are in ASCII).
ASCII code is comparing with the DNA matrix play fair i.e., codan.
Now we perform the play fair that is 16*16 using the key.
After, we get the DNA sequence as output.
The encrypted sequence with the key is send to the receivers end.
